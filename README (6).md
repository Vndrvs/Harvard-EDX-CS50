# EDX / Harvard - CS50's introduction to Python

This repo contains my notes and solutions created while attending the Python introduction course by eDx, mostly for personal usage.

The reason of this repo being public is that I might show these solutions to my tutors or some friend of mine.

- Feel free to use, re-use this code.
